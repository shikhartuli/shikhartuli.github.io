### Performance Engineering
This is the performance engineering course taught by `Prof. Giuliano Casale and Prof. Holger Pirk` in the Spring term `9 Jan 2021 - 26 March 2021`. The course aims at introducing fundamental principles and techniques used in performance management of IT systems, including stand-alone applications and distributed systems, e.g. running in the cloud.

### Deep Learning
This is the deep learning course taught by `Prof. Bernhard Kainz` in the Spring term `9 Jan 2021 - 26 March 2021`. This course addresses the fundamental concepts and advanced methodologies of deep learning and relates them to real-world problems in a variety of domains. The aim is to provide an overview of different approaches, both classical and emerging. 

### Operations Research 
This is the operations research course taught by `Prof. Giuliano Casale and Prof. Dario Paccagnan` in the Autumn term `3 Oct 2020 - 18 Dec 2020`. This course studies quantitative methods for decision making. We emphasise numerical algorithms to solve constrained optimisation programs. The methods studied in this course are applicable to domains including computer science, economics, logistics, and industrial engineering.

### Special Topics in AI (Robotics)
This is the digital logic course taught by `Prof. Rohan Paul` in the Spring term `2 January 2020 - 25 May 2020`. This course will introduce students to the area of learning/AI-based robotics. The course studies the computational aspects of intelligent robotic systems that can sense, reason and act in the physical world often interacting with human partners. This course discusses topics such as probabilistic state estimation, planning and acting under uncertainty, human-robot interaction, learning from reinforcement & demonstration, world modeling etc. I developed the task planning assignment which is avaiable on [GitHub](https://github.com/reail-iitd/COL864-Task-Planning).

### Digital Logic and VHDL Design
This is the digital logic course taught by `Prof. Anshul Kumar` in the Fall term `25 July 2019 - 5 Dec 2019`. The course contents can be broadly divided into two parts. First part deals with the basics of circuit design and includes topics like circuit minimization, sequential circuit design and design of and using RTL building blocks. The second part is focused on ASIC style system design and introduces VHDL, FPGA as implementation technology, synthesis steps as well as testing techniques. Course ends with introducing the challenges of embedded design where software is becoming integral to all devices. The laboratory assignments are a key component of this course and requires students to design and implement circuits and sub-systems on FPGA kits covering almost all the topics covered in the lectures.
