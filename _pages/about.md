I am a Ph.D. candidate at the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Princeton University under the supervision of [Niraj K. Jha](https://www.princeton.edu/~jha/). My main research areas are **Machine Learning**, **Edge Computing**, **Neuro-inspired AI**, **Non-Volatile Memories** and **Nanoelectronics**. Prior to this I was an undergraduate student at the Department of Electrical Engineering at the Indian Institute of Technology Delhi. I am also the founder and CEO of [Qubit Inc.](https://www.qubitinc.in/), a company which works on providing next generation solutions for industrial problems. I have worked as a visiting researcher at the [Embedded Systems Laboratory (ESL)](https://www.epfl.ch/labs/esl/), Institute of Electrical Engineering at EPFL, Switzerland. 

My publications can be seen [here](/publications/). I have also reviewed for top journals including IEEE TCAD, TETC, TII and Wiley SPE. I have also reviewed papers for reputed conferences like CISS, CogSci and ICML. View my CV [here](https://shikhartuli.github.io/assets/pdf/CV.pdf){:target="_blank"}.
