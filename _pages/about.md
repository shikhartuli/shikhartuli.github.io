Hi! I am a senior machine learning engineer at [Apple](https://www.apple.com) and involved with other stealth startups. Before this, I was a senior research scientist at [Samsung Research](https://sra.samsung.com), where I worked on efficient on-device AI models. I completed my Ph.D. at the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Princeton University under the supervision of [Niraj K. Jha](https://www.princeton.edu/~jha/). My main research areas are **Machine Learning**, **Neuroscience-inspired AI**, and **Hardware-software Co-design**. I did my undergraduate studies at the Department of Electrical Engineering, Indian Institute of Technology Delhi. I have also worked as a visiting researcher at the [Embedded Systems Laboratory (ESL)](https://www.epfl.ch/labs/esl/), Institute of Electrical Engineering at EPFL, Switzerland. 

My publications can be seen [here](/publications/). For an up-to-date list, check out my [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=qiFEpzIAAAAJ). I have reviewed for top journals including IEEE TCAD, TEVC, TETC, TII, and Wiley SPE. I have also served as a reviewer for reputed conferences like CISS, CogSci, and ICML.
