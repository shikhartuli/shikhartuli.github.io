I am a senior research scientist at [Samsung Research](https://sra.samsung.com) and a co-founder and CTO at [Illumia AI](https://www.illumia.ai). Before this, I was a Ph.D. candidate at the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Princeton University under the supervision of [Niraj K. Jha](https://www.princeton.edu/~jha/). My main research areas are **Machine Learning**, **Neuroscience-inspired AI**, **Edge Computing**, and **Embedded systems**. I did my undergraduate studies at the Department of Electrical Engineering, Indian Institute of Technology Delhi. I have also worked as a visiting researcher at the [Embedded Systems Laboratory (ESL)](https://www.epfl.ch/labs/esl/), Institute of Electrical Engineering at EPFL, Switzerland. 

My publications can be seen [here](/publications/). I have reviewed for top journals including IEEE TCAD, TEVC, TETC, TII, and Wiley SPE. I have also served as a reviewer for reputed conferences like CISS, CogSci, and ICML. View my CV [here](https://shikhartuli.github.io/assets/pdf/CV.pdf){:target="_blank"}.
